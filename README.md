# CitiBikeTableau
This project demonstrates Tableau interactive data visualization powered by Citi Bike data including over 60 million rows from July 1, 2013, through May 27, 2018.

The Citi Bike cleanse dataset is housed into a Google BigQuery Data Warehouse using a centralized table. On the other hand, the Citi Bike raw system data can be found at the following URL: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

Additionally, I have provided 1) the functional Tableau workbook with tooltip popup windows that shows useful metadata and 2) screenshots of the said Tableau data visualization tool with quick analytical observations since the entire dataset is too huge to upload.

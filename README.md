# CitiBikeTableau
This project demonstrates Tableau interactive data visualization powered by Citi Bike data including over 60 millions rows from July 1, 2013 through May 27, 2018.

The Citi Bike cleanse dataset is housed into a Google BigQuery Data Warehouse using a centralized table. I have provided above screenshots of the said Tableau data visualization tool since the entire dataset is too huge to upload. Also, the Citi Bike raw system data can be found at the following url: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

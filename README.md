# CitiBikeTableau
This project demonstrates Tableau interactive data visualization powered by Citi Bike data including over 60 millions rows

The CitiBike clean dataset is housed into a Google BigQuery Data Warehouse using a centralized table. I have provided above screenshots of the Tableau dashboards since the entire dataset is too huge to upload. The CitiBike raw data can be found at the following url: https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
